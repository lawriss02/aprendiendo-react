# React + Vite

- I created this small project in order to practice my basic knowledgment of React JS. 
- I got inspired by the w3school website, which has these kind of exercicis for learning the sintaxis of different programming languages. These 3 examples are taken from the js course.
- I learned the principals of React through out midudev's youtube course.


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
